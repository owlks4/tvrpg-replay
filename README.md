# Titanic Voyage RPG replay

### Explanation

Titanic Voyage RPG is an online game/experience that runs every year in sync with the Titanic's maiden voyage.

While it isn't historically representative and is ultimately a curiosity more than anything, the event is simulated with hundreds of players, and therefore a lot of roleplay-driven data about player movement is generated. This movement data is implicitly released in the form of message logs.

**This webpage geolocates that data onto a map of the ship** - so you can see the flow of players around the game world, and especially how the movement patterns change following the iceberg impact at 11:40pm.

### Limitations
Locations are, at all times, based on individuals' most recent speaking location - not always their actual location, as there's no robust way of finding that.
This is why you have random players hanging out on the forecastle when they should be underwater - it's where they last spoke.
