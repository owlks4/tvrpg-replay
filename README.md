# Titanic Voyage RPG replay

### Explanation

Titanic Voyage RPG is an online game/experience that runs every year in sync with the Titanic's maiden voyage.

While it isn't historically representative and is ultimately a curiosity more than anything, the event is simulated with hundreds of players, and therefore generates a wealth of roleplay-driven data about player movement. This movement data is implicitly released in the form of message logs.

**This webpage geolocates that data onto a map of the ship** - so you can see the flow of players around the game world, and especially how the movement patterns change following the iceberg impact at 11:40pm.

### Limitations
Locations are, at all times, based on individuals' most recent *speaking* location - not always their actual location, as there's no robust way of finding that.
For most individuals, the effect of this is negligible, as most players speak consistently throughout the night. But this is the reason for random characters appearing to stay on the forecastle when it's already underwater - it is very likely that they DID leave the area before it flooded, but because they did not speak in their new location, the system has no way to update their position. Again, this is not a problem for most characters, as shown by the consistent flurry of movement around the ship all throughout the viewed period.
