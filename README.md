# Titanic Marconi messages map

A 3D map depicting the exchange of wireless messages in the North Atlantic on April 15th, 1912 - the night the Titanic sank. (Marconi: the wireless communication technology employed by most of the ships on the map.)

## Instructions:

* Left mouse button + drag: Rotate camera.
* Right mouse button + drag: Move camera.
* Scroll: Zoom in/out.

Use the slider to change the time, and mouse over the messages to see them in Morse Code - which is how the messages would actually have been delivered.

You can also use the next/previous message buttons at the top to quickly flit along the timeline.

In terms of sources, this project mainly uses CanadaDan's interpretation of the message logs, but with the timings adjusted to those given by Paul Lee.
