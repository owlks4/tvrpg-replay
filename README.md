# Titanic Voyage RPG movements replay

This is a record of player locations across the ship (read: interconnected IRC chats) during the Titanic Voyage RPG sinking event, compiled from the message log.

This means that these locations are, at all times, based on individuals' most recent speaking location - not always their actual location, as there's no robust way of finding that.
This is why you have random players hanging out on the forecastle when they should be underwater - it's where they last spoke.
